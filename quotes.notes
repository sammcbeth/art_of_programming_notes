"the understanding of the theory of a routine may be greatly aided by providingm at the time of constuction on or two statements converning the state of the machine at well chosen points... in the extemem form of the theoretical method a watertight mathematical proof is provided for the assertions. in the exteme form of the experimental method the routine is tried out on the machine with a variety of initial conditions and is pronounced fit if the assertions hold in each case. Both methods have their weaknesses." alfred turing
