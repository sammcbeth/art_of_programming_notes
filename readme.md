# Notes for The Art of Computer Programming, Donald Knuth

This is a simple repo containing my notes for the series The Art of Computer programming by
Donald Knuth. Im seeking to go through books 1-4a for now and will decide on going further when
I get to the end of 4a

## Background Info

In April 2019 I decided to commit myself to learning to program. However i noticed right from the 
start that most people trying to learn to program outside of a college degree skipped straight to 
web development and focused on learning the latest and greatest web framework(s) rather than learning
anything about the fundamentals of computers or computer programming.

This method didn't appeal to me for a multitude of reasons, chief among them I just didn't believe
it would be effective in the long run. From studying applied math in college I have an appreciation 
for what a strong foundation, or lack therof, can do when trying to learn technical topics. I 
understand that web frameworks were just tools that would come and go and that having a strong 
foundation in the fundamentals of programming would be more beneficial to where i wanted to go with
my career.
    
Thus enters this series. I am using these books as my 'formal' cs education while learning web technologies and other things i find interesting along the way.

This repository is my collection of notes as I go through the series.

### Personal Prerequisites

Before Starting this endeavor I earned a bachelors degree in applied mathematics with concentration 
in industrial engineering from the Eniversity of California, Berkeley. I currently work as a Data Analyst.

## Acknowledgments

My utmost thanks to Donald Knuth et al. for writing and putting this series together. 
An anonymous thanks to the various internet strangers who referenced these books as the best 
culmination of cs information in one location.
